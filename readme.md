# Hackathon Solution
This was my solution to the hackathon for UtahJS Conf 2019.

What you see here is the core of what I did during the event, but also includes a lot of work I did after the fact.

The issue was to successfully navigate an n-dimensional maze while maximizing your score.
Each step taken would reduce your score by one, but prizes could be picked up to increase your score.

I ended up using a modified Djikstra floodfill to work it out. In the hour alloted, I got a score good enough to get second place!
